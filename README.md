🎲 Blackjack is a popular two-player card game that is played with a deck of standard playing cards around the world in casinos. The main criteria for winning this game are chance and strategy. The challenge of this game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding them. That is why it is also known as Twenty-One.

*Rules of Blackjack game*🎯 

In blackjack, each player and dealer receives two cards. 

The player can then choose to “play” (request another card) or “stop” (keep on hold until a new request is made). The goal in this game is to keep the sum of all card points equal to 21 without exceeding it.

Face cards (i.e. Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 11 points. If a player has more than 21 points then the player automatically loses the game.
